Moving Average js implementation with random values on input. This is just a POC how it's working in "real", kind of simulation and prof that is working as supposed to. If we know the range of rand() we can easly calculate the output results which shoud bounce arround rand() range/2 if the window size is biger then the output should be really clocse to half of rand function range

For a graphical inscenisation I used Plotly.js
